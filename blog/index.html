        <h2>Migrating our Ansible roles to a collection</h2>
        <span class="time">Sunday, Nov 8, 2020</span>
        In July 2020 we decided to move our existing Ansible roles for Linux, ssh, nginx and MySQL into an Ansible collection (what is a collection?).
Why? Having only one repository for all roles means we don&rsquo;t have to duplicate code. We have one common test-suite for all roles that works the same for every role. Also Collections are the future, as there is possibly no support for roles in the next version of Ansible Galaxy (see ansible/galaxy_ng#58).

        <h2>Automating dev-sec releases with Github Actions</h2>
        <span class="time">Saturday, May 30, 2020</span>
        Hey friends,
some time ago someone who uses our Ansible roles created an issue in our ansible-os-hardening role stating that the readme in the Ansible Galaxy diverged from the actual releases you can find on Galaxy. The reason for that is simple: Galaxy shows the from the master-branch in the Github-repository - not from the latest release that is uploaded there. That produced a discrepancy between the functions of the role and what is described in the readme.

it&rsquo;s Hacktoberfest 2019 and we from the DevSec project are taking part in it! And this year not only as contributors but as maintainers as well. We looked for issues in our Chef-cookbooks, Ansible-roles, Puppet-Modules and InSpec-profiles that are good candidates for your contributions to Hacktoberfest. Then we collected them in our Github-project so you have one place to find them all!
So go grab a Issue, create a Pull Request and grab your Hacktoberfest-swag!

        Dear DevSec friends,
today, we released many DevSec baselines. Thank you, the dev-sec community, for all the contributions to make it happen. We released:
 Windows Baseline 2.0.0 and 1.2.0 Linux Baseline 2.3.0 Nginx Baselinne 2.3.0 MySQL Baseline 3.1.0 Apache Baseline 2.1.0 Postgres Baseline 2.0.4 Linux Patch Baseline 0.5.0  Especially, I&rsquo;d like to thank Karsten Müller from Lichtblick, Patrick Münch and Torsten Löbner TLoebner from SVA for their major contribution to our Windows baseline.

        Dear DevSec friends,
Some of you maybe already noticed, we are improving the website of the project: updating the content, rebuilding and refreshing it.
Besides that, we took a decision to change some of the communication ways of the project.
Gitter chat was not heavily used in the past and wasn&rsquo;t accepted even by some of core maintainers. As mailing lists are still a wide used communication way of many OpenSource projects, we decided to give them a try:

        Hi Security Friends,
We had this update in the works for a while and the new homepage is finally here. I&rsquo;ll look at some of the updates and encourage you to reach out for future improvements.
We finally migrated from our old custom-built pages to Hugo and combined our frontpage, blog and documentation into one single repository. This is easier to maintain and to contribute to. Besides these technical improvements, we also worked on the user experience, a fresh front-page, and a new contributor page, and and improved baseline overview.

SELinux is unmanaged per default and can be enabled via setting ['os-hardening']['security']['selinux_mode'] (PR 173, many thanks to AnMoeller for this contribution) Adaptation of some attributes to better RH defaults (PR 177, many thanks to strangeman for updating the baseline)  New attributes and features:

        The mission of DevSec Hardening Framework is to provide users with the best content to stay secure across their infrastructure fleet. We started by providing hardening solutions written in Chef cookbooks, Puppet modules as well as Ansible modules. Beginning of this year, we started to transform our testing suite into standalone InSpec baselines. Since then we added more and more baselines like Nginx, TLS/SSL, OpenStack, MySQL or PostgreSQL.
We are happy to announce that we got a major contribution by Kristian Vlaardingerbroek from Schuberg Philis.

As always, they provide new features and configuration possibilities for you to use! More on that below.

 block-storage compute dashboard identity networking orchestration telemetry  But we still have some white spots:
 data-processing databases messaging  The baseline is designed to work hand-in-hand with multiple configuration management tools like Ansible, Chef or Puppet, which allows you to run the baseline easily against existing deployments.

        Happy New Year DevSec users,
from day one of the DevSec Hardening Framework project, we used the same test suites for our Ansible, Chef and Puppet implementations. Those test suites have been implemented in [Serverspec]() and helped us to enforce the same rules for all hardening implementations. The combination with [test-kitchen]() allowed us to easily test Ansible, Chef and Puppet implementations across the multiple operating systems with the same test suites.

Next to bug-fixes and support for additional operating systems, this release focused on making the os-hardening and ssh-hardening roles more configurable. This allows you to alter them to your needs while still providing a strong baseline security.
As always, thanks for all the contributors!

Core focus of the last release was to improve and ease the installation via Ansible Galaxy.
For os-hardening:

        <h2>Ansible joins Hardening Framework</h2>
        <span class="time">Thursday, Apr 30, 2015</span>
        The Hardening Framework provides best-practice security for DevOps by implementing server hardening with DevOps tools. We are happy to announce that with help of Sebastian Gumprich we were able to implement our first Ansible role: ansible-ssh-hardening. Over the last weeks, we worked hard to release version 1.0:
 Implement ssh hardening to meet our tests Setup test infrastructure with kitchen-ansible Implement travis tests#7 Add handlers to restart sshd only when necessary #6 Add support for Oracle Linux #2  The module is available via Ansible Galaxy, now.

Both problems have been addressed with processes and strong governance. While improving the situation considerably, failures are still unavoidable and often unmitigated. I have seen various companies with great risk and security management, that still suffer from severe configuration issues and unpatched machines.

        Next We are happy to announce, that the Hardening Framework moved to its new home. As a vendor neutral project we aim to provide best-practice system hardening for various industries. We are now actively searching for supporters to build up the next level of this project. Get in touch with us.
Retrospection About a year ago the Hardening Framework has started as a small challenge to proof if server hardening can be done with configuration management tools like Puppet, Chef, SaltStack or Ansible.
