DevSec Hardening Framework project is releasing a new major release [chef-ssh-hardening 2.0.0](https://github.com/dev-sec/chef-ssh-hardening/releases/tag/v2.0.0) today.

**Highlights and breaking changes:**

- On the modern chef versions (>= 12.10) autodiscovery of openssh version is used in the decision logic of crypto parameters
- New attribute namespace `['ssh-hardening']` for the entire cookbook
- Split of attributes to the `server` and `client` namespaces
- `UsePAM` is now set to `yes` per default (and does not break RHEL installations if set to `no`)
- Usage of different encryption algorithms based on the available openssh version
- Removal of DSA support
- Usage of strong primes for Diffie-Hellman

**New attributes:**

- `['ssh-hardening']['ssh']['client']['send_env']` and `['ssh-hardening']['ssh']['server']['accept_env']` allow configuration of accepted/sent environment parameters
- `['ssh-hardening']['ssh'][{'client', 'server'}]['kex']` , `['ssh-hardening']['ssh'][{'client', 'server'}]['mac']` and `['ssh-hardening']['ssh'][{'client', 'server'}]['cipher']` allow configuration of own crypto parameters
- `['ssh-hardening']['ssh']['server']['log_level']` allows configuration of sshd logging level
- `['ssh-hardening']['ssh']['server']['dh_min_prime_size']`, `['ssh-hardening']['ssh']['server']['dh_build_primes']` and `['ssh-hardening']['ssh']['server']['dh_build_primes_size']` allow configuration of DH prime parameters

**Removal of deprecated code/features:**

- Removal of user management / key management for root user
- Removal of old global attributes with crypto parameters: `['ssh-hardening']['ssh']['cbc_required']`, `['ssh-hardening']['ssh']['weak_hmac']` and `['ssh-hardening']['ssh']['weak_kex']`
