Dear DevSec friends,

it's [Hacktoberfest 2019](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) and we from the [DevSec project](https://dev-sec.io/) are taking part in it!
And this year not only as contributors but as maintainers as well.
We looked for issues in our Chef-cookbooks, Ansible-roles, Puppet-Modules and InSpec-profiles that are good candidates for your contributions to Hacktoberfest.
Then we collected them in our [Github-project](https://github.com/orgs/dev-sec/projects/2) so you have one place to find them all!

So go grab a Issue, create a Pull Request and grab your Hacktoberfest-swag!
