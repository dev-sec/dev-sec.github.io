Due to unfortunate circumstances we can't use hardening.io domain anymore. Therefore Hardening Framework moved to a new home: [http://dev-sec.io](http://dev-sec.io) , [https://github.com/dev-sec](https://github.com/dev-sec).

Forwarding can't be configured from hardening.io to the new domain. We know this leads to confusion and we are sorry for that.
