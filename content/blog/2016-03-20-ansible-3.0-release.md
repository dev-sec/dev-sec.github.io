The Hardening Framework once again updates its framework's Ansible modules, making them compatible with the new Ansible 2.0 release!
But that's not all. Next to bug-fixes and support for additional operating systems, this release focused on making the [os-hardening](https://github.com/dev-sec/ansible-os-hardening) and [ssh-hardening](https://github.com/dev-sec/ansible-ssh-hardening) roles more configurable. This allows you to alter them to your needs while still providing a strong baseline security.

As always, thanks for all the contributors!
