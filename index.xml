      <description>Dear DevSec friends,
Some of you maybe already noticed, we are improving the website of the project: updating the content, rebuilding and refreshing it.
Besides that, we took a decision to change some of the communication ways of the project.
Gitter chat was not heavily used in the past and wasn&amp;rsquo;t accepted even by some of core maintainers. As mailing lists are still a wide used communication way of many OpenSource projects, we decided to give them a try:</description>

      <description>Hi Security Friends,
We had this update in the works for a while and the new homepage is finally here. I&amp;rsquo;ll look at some of the updates and encourage you to reach out for future improvements.
We finally migrated from our old custom-built pages to Hugo and combined our frontpage, blog and documentation into one single repository. This is easier to maintain and to contribute to. Besides these technical improvements, we also worked on the user experience, a fresh front-page, and a new contributor page, and and improved baseline overview.</description>

      <description>The mission of DevSec Hardening Framework is to provide users with the best content to stay secure across their infrastructure fleet. We started by providing hardening solutions written in Chef cookbooks, Puppet modules as well as Ansible modules. Beginning of this year, we started to transform our testing suite into standalone InSpec baselines. Since then we added more and more baselines like Nginx, TLS/SSL, OpenStack, MySQL or PostgreSQL.
We are happy to announce that we got a major contribution by Kristian Vlaardingerbroek from Schuberg Philis.</description>

      <guid>https://dev-sec.io/blog/2017-04-13-openstack-profile/</guid>
      <description>I am happy to announce that the Chef Partners Team contributed a new OpenStack Baseline to our DevSec project. This Baseline is implementing the OpenStack Security Guide in InSpec. JJ Asghar will continue to be a core maintainer.
The baseline is already covering a wide range of checks for:
 block-storage compute dashboard identity networking orchestration telemetry  But we still have some white spots:
 data-processing databases messaging  The baseline is designed to work hand-in-hand with multiple configuration management tools like Ansible, Chef or Puppet, which allows you to run the baseline easily against existing deployments.</description>

      <description>Happy New Year DevSec users,
from day one of the DevSec Hardening Framework project, we used the same test suites for our Ansible, Chef and Puppet implementations. Those test suites have been implemented in [Serverspec]() and helped us to enforce the same rules for all hardening implementations. The combination with [test-kitchen]() allowed us to easily test Ansible, Chef and Puppet implementations across the multiple operating systems with the same test suites.</description>

      <guid>https://dev-sec.io/blog/2016-09-20-ansible-nginx-released/</guid>
      <description>The next part of server hardening with Ansible is released today: The ansible-nginx-hardening role.
This role hardens your existing nginx installations (version 1.0.15 or later).
This time we tried to make sure that the hardening role works with popular nginx installation roles, so if you use any of the following (great!) roles to manage your nginx, you can use our hardening role:
 geerlinggux.nginx jdauphant.nginx franklinkim.nginx  We also tried to provide good documentation on the various settings and think that it turned out very well, but see for yourself.</description>

      <description>Even though the Github repository already got 17 stars at the time of writing, we never officially released the ansible-mysql-hardening role. Today we change that and release 1.0.0!
The mysql-hardening role joins the other two already existing Ansible roles, ssh-hardening and os-hardening.
This role hardens a MySQL server according to best practices and implements the same guidelines as our successful Chef and Puppet implementations.
The main work was done by Anton Lugovoi and Sebastian Gumprich who implemented the following changes:</description>

      <description>Due to unfortunate circumstances we can&amp;rsquo;t use hardening.io domain anymore. Therefore Hardening Framework moved to a new home: http://dev-sec.io , https://github.com/dev-sec.
Forwarding can&amp;rsquo;t be configured from hardening.io to the new domain. We know this leads to confusion and we are sorry for that.</description>

      <description>The Hardening Framework once again updates its framework&amp;rsquo;s Ansible modules, making them compatible with the new Ansible 2.0 release! But that&amp;rsquo;s not all. Next to bug-fixes and support for additional operating systems, this release focused on making the os-hardening and ssh-hardening roles more configurable. This allows you to alter them to your needs while still providing a strong baseline security.
As always, thanks for all the contributors!
Notable changes for os-hardening:</description>

      <description>Continuously, the Hardening Framework improves its framework to cover up-to-date server hardening. Sebastian Gumprich and Anton Lugovoi did an amazing job to improve the Ansible implementation for os-hardening and ssh-hardening. Core focus of the last release was to improve and ease the installation via Ansible Galaxy.
For os-hardening:
 Fix a bug in the passwdqc template (#51) Change directory layout so the role is easily installable from ansible-galaxy (#49) Improved travis-tests to cover more cases (#42) Fix passwdqc default options (#44) Remove duplicate &amp;ldquo;update pam&amp;rdquo; task (#46) Fix stuck in case pam files was updated before by force update (#45) Fix nologin shell path (#44)  For ssh-hardening:</description>

      <description>After two months of development the Hardening Framework team is glad to announce that we created our second Ansible role: ansible-os-hardening. This role hardens a Linux operating system according to best practices and implements the same guidelines as our successful Chef and Puppet implementations.
In these two months Sebastian Gumprich implemented with the help of Christoph Hartmann and Dominik Richter the following changes:
 Implement os-hardening to meet our tests Enable GPG-checking on all yum-repository files #5 Disable system accounts #6 Module-loading configuration #22 Travis support #17  As always, this role supports Debian- and Enterprise Linux-based operating systems.</description>

      <description>The Hardening Framework provides best-practice security for DevOps by implementing server hardening with DevOps tools. We are happy to announce that with help of Sebastian Gumprich we were able to implement our first Ansible role: ansible-ssh-hardening. Over the last weeks, we worked hard to release version 1.0:
 Implement ssh hardening to meet our tests Setup test infrastructure with kitchen-ansible Implement travis tests#7 Add handlers to restart sshd only when necessary #6 Add support for Oracle Linux #2  The module is available via Ansible Galaxy, now.</description>

      <description>Despite many advancements in the field of security, two fundamental issues have stayed at the core of many attacks over the last 20 years. They preveil despite firewalls, SIEMs, or scanners. They are: Misconfiguration and unpatched software with known vulnerabilities.
Both problems have been addressed with processes and strong governance. While improving the situation considerably, failures are still unavoidable and often unmitigated. I have seen various companies with great risk and security management, that still suffer from severe configuration issues and unpatched machines.</description>

      <description>Challenge Running secure infrastructure is a difficult task. Although server hardening is a well-known topic with many guides out in the wild, it is still very cumbersome to apply and verify secure configuration. If you manage many server, they need to be configured properly and maintained, which is difficult and time-consuming to get right. To answer these needs for security, compliance, and maintainability, we decided to launch this project as a common ground for requirements and their fulfillment.</description>
